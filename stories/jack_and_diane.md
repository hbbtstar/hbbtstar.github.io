title: Jack and Diane
---


Bucksville was a town that, for better or for worse, got stuck inside the latter end of the nineteen fifties. Football reigned, prom kings and queens ruled the world, and nerds and jocks just didn't get along. There were still soda shops and barbers, cobblers and carpenters, a general store.  I suppose it was stuck not in a time but in a stereotype, some old and grossly misshapen vision of heartland America; generations lived and died there, but those who left stayed gone.

Our story begins with the center of this fantastic little world, a high school boy who we'll call Jack. He was the quarterback of the team and enjoyed the perks that comes with. He was a star in his own right, getting free food and drink at many spots in town. He rode around in a car the town had bought him, owing to his victory over their rivals in the state championships his junior year. He dated a girl named Diane, widely acknowledged by everyone to be the prettiest girl the town had ever seen. And they were right.

You already know what Diane looked like. She was blonde and slender, with a face that was smooth as porcelain and eyes bluer than the sky. She had curves in all the right places and looked amazing in a skirt; her legs, toned and long, tempted the eyes of all but the most faithful of men. She was the captain of the cheerleading squad, as our story's strictures dictate, and so Jack got to see her often in a skirt.

If you talked to anyone in that town, you knew that those two were meant for each other. Old Jack, they'd say; strong as a mule and handsome, too. And check out that Diane girl, see how she fits snugly, locking her arm with his as they walk down the street together. Oh boy, but does Cupid fire true or what? He sure does, they'd say, as Jack and Diane laughed and smiled together outside the soda shops and football games. He sure does.

That's not what they would say. But it's exactly what they'd mean.

Adults and kids alike got drunk on beer and sport, their half-crazed cheers edging their beloved Cougars on to victory. Jack was front and center, and he liked to hear his name cheered. It was like a chant; a rhythmic prayer of “Jack! Jack! Jack!” that spurred whatever god had heard it to grace him with a win. Diane would lead it, and when he could he would look over at her. Eyes that seemed to never leave would see the swivel of the helmet, and she would smile a brilliant smile that made his heart melt each and every time.

The Cougars went on to win the game by a touchdown, an outcome agreed upon by all as a solid win. The team filed back into the locker room amidst the raging crowd and returned to find the same; tonight would be a night to remember, they told themselves. Jack scanned the crowds for Diane, finding her among her squad. She saw him and ran to throw her delicate little arms around him.

“Hey stranger.” she said, giving him a quick kiss. “You were great out there tonight.”

“Thanks. So were you.” he replied. “Are you ready to go? Dan's having the after-party at his house. It's going to be a good time, everyone will be there.”

“Sure am, sugar.” she said. “Let's go show those guys how the big kids play.”

The party was, at the risk of becoming redundant, exactly what you might expect from a party in such a place. Beer was had, people were drunk, and to this day I'm fairly sure a few children can be matched with mistakes their parents made on beautiful autumn evenings. Jack and Diane, for their part, had as good a time as any and made the rounds with accolades and hearty congratulations- he the star and she his doting trophy, both the hero and envy of all present.

“Hey baby.” Diane said. She smiled and brushed his hand. “I'm kind of tired of this joint. Let's go somewhere quieter.”

“Sure.” he said. He smiled a bit when she said that. He knew what quieter meant for her, but he had something different in mind. He thought about the little old treehouse that lay hidden at the end of Rucker Street. It was not a treehouse so much as a platform overgrown, the climbing ruts and sitting spots barely distinguishable from the tree they were nailed on. When he found it, Jack had been fascinated by a board that was fast disappearing as the tree grew around it; he imagined some other boy, years later, not ever knowing a board had been there.

The ruts almost led up to the top, and with a little effort you could reach a square platform that was most likely once a ceiling. It had barely held his weight his first time up, and most any sane person would have left it to be consumed in whole like that board was. But not Jack. He liked the height and the tree, the seclusion at the end of Rucker Street. He decided to fix it, give it a dressing-up and show it to Diane.

Now Jack was a busy boy, what with school and football and Diane, and it took him nearly two weeks and every bit of his spare time to finally patch up the treehouse. He found, to his surprise, some degree of satisfaction in building it. He didn't know instinctively what to do or how to do it; he went to the library and looked up carpentry, studying carefully each diagram and paragraph.  He took the sharpest knife his father owned and grooved the ruts deeper, so she wouldn't slip on her way up. He trimmed some of the branches off near the top, and made new holds so there would be no tricky maneuvering. That took him a few days.

Next he moved on to the platform proper. It was in a state of rotting disrepair, and after much consideration he ripped it apart and built it again from scratch. He built the new one piece by piece, anchoring it well to the tree. He brought weights to the top, as a test. It collapsed the first time, and Jack felt a whisper of excitement. The second held firm, made all the better by his failure with the first. That took him another few days.

He made a slight covering on one side of the platform, in case it rained. He was most proud of that over all; he had reused the branches he had trimmed, along with their leaves, to create what he deemed the most natural-looking lean-to this side of Bucksville. He poured water carefully over each part of the roof to make sure it was rainproof, and then he sanded down the boards and walls, careful to see that not even a wayward splinter threatened. That took him right up to the very end of two weeks.

“Where we going, stranger?” Diane asked after they had been walking down Rucker Street for a few minutes.

“You'll see.” he replied.

“Quiet and secretive. You are a treat.” she said, smiling and nuzzling her face into his varsity jacket. She held him close until they reached the tree at the end of Rucker Street, at which point they stopped and he motioned to the tree.

“Ladies first.” he said. She looked up at the tree for a moment; he saw a momentary flicker of confusion in her eyes and the smile faltered so little that Jack still isn't sure it did.

“Such a gentleman.” she said, starting to climb. “You better keep your head down, mister.”

“No other thought had crossed my mind.” he said, smiling.

They reached the top of the tree, and Jack breathed a silent sigh of relief when the platform didn't come crashing down around them. He laid down and watched Diane look around for a moment. He watched her take in the boards, and the lean-to; she came to lay down next to him soon.

“I re-built it. It was almost gone when I found it, but I fixed it up. What do you think?” he asked her.

“Oh, it's beautiful. You sure know how to make a girl swoon.” she said, leaning in to kiss him.

“And look at the stars!” he said. “I chose it because you can see the stars.”

“They're amazing.” she said. She clutched his face firmly in her hands, forcing his lips towards her. “But at the moment I'm interested in something else.”

And so they did what lovers do when they're alone, and in love; it was perfect. So perfect that Jack thought he had stepped right into a story. He looked up at the stars again.

“What do you want to be when you grow up?” he said suddenly.

“What?” she said. He kept looking at the stars. He had never asked anyone this before; he felt strange and maybe a little childish saying it. But the moment was right, she was right, and that's what lovers did in the stories. They lay next to each other and told each other their thoughts and fears, wishes and worries, dreams and secrets they had sheltered forever from the world.

“Well?” he said. She laughed.

“What a question.” she said. She snuggled up close to him and closed her eyes. “We'll get married and have lots of kids.”

The answer didn't surprise him; it's what he had thought up until now, as well.

“Yeah. It's just... haven't you ever wanted to do something else?” he said. He suddenly felt quite a bit childlike, indeed. “You know, it's just... looking at the stars, I know there's a lot more out there. I want to experience it, I think. You know?”

Diane whispered something sharply that Jack was unable to hear.

“Nothing?” he asked her. “Not anything?”

“Jack, don't be silly.” she said. “Maybe you'll play pro ball. That'd be something, huh? And I could cheer you on, just like always.”

“Yeah. Maybe.” he said, falling back and letting her mold herself into his form once again. Thoughts rose unbidden but not entirely unwelcome to his head, and Jack's mistake was to listen to them.

“I wanted to be an astronaut.” he said abruptly.

“You what? Where is this coming from?” she said. “You never wanted to be an astronaut.”

“Well, maybe I do now.” he said. “Well, maybe not that. But something, you know?”

“No, I don't.” she said. He could hear irritation creeping into her voice. “If you really want, you can go to college. Play ball there. How about that?”

“How about that?” he said. Though that was always what he envisioned for himself,  it suddenly seemed so bleak. “Is my whole life going to be throwing a ball around?”

“No, of course not.” she said, not a little harshly. “Some of it will involve me.”

“Well, maybe I don't want to play ball anymore!” he said, standing up. “Maybe I want something more. How about I become an astronaut, and I go up to Mars. I'm the first one ever to land on Mars. And you're my wife. And I'm on my way back, but there's something wrong, and I steel my gaze and say I love you. Wouldn't that be something?”

“You're too tall to be an astronaut, Jack.” she said. “ And that's silly. Cut it out.”

But Diane could not deflate him. Poor Jack had been caught. He wasn't sure what happened to him now at this moment, but he knew that it was different. He was rambling and babbling and not making a whole lot of sense, but he felt alive and he wanted to go; to do something, anything. That's always how it happened in the stories.

“Let's go.” he said. “Let's leave here. Right now.”

Diane sighed in frustration.

“I'm serious! Let's get out of here.” he said. “We can take my car, the nice new one the Mayor gave to me. We can ride around, I can do odd jobs for money. We can see the Grand Canyon, go to Mexico, do whatever we like! You can wear your sunglasses and drink a milkshake, and it'll be sunny and amazing and we can say that we love each other as much as we want. Wouldn't that be exciting as hell?”

“Stop it, Jack.” she said.

“I love you, Diane.” he replied.

“You're scaring me.” she said.

That wasn't how it was supposed to happen, Jack told himself. She was supposed to jump up and scream that she loved him too, and they would ride away and be astronauts or adventurers or anything romantic and seductive. They were supposed to love forever. That's how it happened in the stories.

“I don't mean to.” he said. “Let's take a ride. See where we end up.”

“We're not going to take a ride; this is ridiculous. We're going home.” she said, grabbing her coat. “Come on, Jack. You're going to sleep and you'll sober up and you'll be yourself in the morning.”

But Jack didn't move. You see, Jack did quite a lot of figuring out that day; he figured out he wasn't a quarterback, that he was an astronaut. And he figured out that maybe what had come before was wrong, and that he was stuck in a spot he should not be in. He looked at Diane again.

“Jack. Let's go. Now.” she said, clipping each word with barely concealed rage.

He looked at her and saw her hair flipping gently in the wind, yellow as the sun. He saw her ruby lips, her porcelain skin. She looked a bit like a doll, he thought. Well, he didn't want a doll anymore. Who says that Jack needs his Diane at the end of the day?

“Then go, Diane.” he said. “I think I'll stay here awhile.”

He heard her climb down the ruts of the tree, heard her feet crunch on the autumn leaves when she hit the bottom. She seemed comfortable placing each foot in each rut, confidently following the path he had carved for her. He waited until he could hear her no longer, and then he climbed down himself. He started walking past the end of Rucker Street. He walked to where the streetlights ended and trees began sprouting into woods. He used to be afraid of the dark, when he was younger; now the pitch blackness was comforting. He heard some birds he could not name whistle in the darkness, and he whistled back. He heard some animals rustle about in the leaves, and he wanted to laugh giddily because, for the first time in his life, he did not know what came next.
