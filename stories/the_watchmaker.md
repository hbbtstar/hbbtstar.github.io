title: The Watchmaker
---


The town of Ovid has been described at different times to be different things, all depending on the one who said them. It is beautiful, nostalgic, boring, pedantic, and all the other words in-between; one common word, however, is cold. No claim was ever made that friendly winters visit the north of New York, and Ovid was no exception. Snow came fast and hard and lasted all the season; at the time this tale begins, in fact, Ovid had just received three feet of it.

Snow has a way of clearing the streets. Families file dutifully back into their homes and light their fires; the glistening white vista remains unbroken until the dirty, rumbling plows can clear the roads. Ice is rampant and it's tough to trudge through snow packed waist-high or higher; not for the faint of heart is walking on a day like this one, and most are content to let the world pass them by for awhile.

But there are, here and there, some figures who dot the streets. There is one in particular who crunches through Ovid's endless white; a tall, thin figure in a heavy brown coat and boots worn thin by more than one winter. He carries a small wooden box, outstanding only in its plainness, and he holds it as a mother might hold a child. He presses onward towards his destination, the snow no impediment to his stoic advance.

Inside the box is a watch. The band is extraordinarily thin, a pattern of gold and silver interwoven in such a way as to play upon light in the most intricate manner. The hands of the watch are gray, framed on their outside edges by a silver lining,   and protected by a very fine layer of crystal.

The face of the watch, however, is by far its most impressive feature; behind the hands is a woman, etched inside the crystal with a precision almost unnatural. Her hair is wavy and unkempt; her eyes are brilliant and deep. They are so warm and inviting that even those who have never seen her before feel they have known her all their lives. 

It is flawless in every way, and in fact it was made by that same tall, thin figure who clutches it to his chest; it is a gift for the woman depicted on it, and its exquisite beauty is simply a reflection of the love and care that our watchmaker took in its creation. He brings it now as a present, and as he climbs her steps and knocks on her door he hopes fervently that it is good enough for her.

“What the heck are you doing here?” she says, opening the door. She wears a dress, black and elegant, and her blonde hair is down in its marvelous curls. He thinks she is beautiful. “You look frozen! Get in here!”

“Oh, it's not so bad out there. I've walked worse.” says the watchmaker. He steps into the foyer of the house, knocking his boots on the doormat. “Where are you going? You look good.”

“Listen, we need to talk. I-” she begins. He silences her with a gesture, holding up the box.

“Wait- I want to give you this.” he says. He opens it swiftly but gently; he allows her to take in its beauty. She lifts it out of the box, placing it upon her wrist.

“Oh god... it's gorgeous.” she says. Her enthusiasm is strained, and the watchmaker notices.

“What's wrong?” he says, taking her hand.

“Look, I need to tell you something.” she says. She pulls her hand away from his, and before she even begins he knows what has happened. “This here... what we have... this isn't going to work.”  

She does not look at the watchmaker; she looks instead at the watch on her wrist, rubbing it back and forth, back and forth.

“There's someone else.” she says. “I don't... I can't be with you anymore. I'm sorry. This is just how it has to be.”

She continues to rub the watch- back and forth, back and forth. It is a moment of quiet, tense and unbroken. The only sound is the soft slide of the watch against her skin.

“I don't... you should go.” she says. She unclasps the watch, offering it to him. The watchmaker does not move, save to speak.

“Please, don't.” she says, cutting him off. “This is hard enough.”

And so the watchmaker is silent. He takes his watch, placing it back in its case with care. He puts on his brown coat and steps into his worn boots, opening the door to the outside. He is not ten feet from her front door when he hears it close with an awful, final click.

The watchmaker walks back through the snow that covers the town of Ovid; he walks back through the path that he carved such a short time ago. He does not notice the snow, or the ice, or the terrible, biting winds that seem to mock him. He does not notice the numbness in his face, or in his hands, or in his feet; he does not, in fact, notice much of anything at all.

Instead he remembers; he remembers her, and how she felt. He remembers the way that she fit so well into his arms when they lay together on those cold, winter nights. He remembers how just her presence made him smile, and how easy it was to make her laugh. He remembers, as he walks into his home, how much she seemed to love him.

There is a dark corner of the mind that threatens, at some times, to envelop us in what ifs and if-onlys; right now, as he gazes at the watch in front of him, the watchmaker is full within its grasp. He wonders if he should have done something different. He wonders if he could have been handsomer, or richer, or smarter or kinder; what should he have been to keep her in his arms? He wonders if she will laugh the same with others. He cries what if, and if only, and lingers in that corner of the mind better left unopened.

This corner of the mind, however, can also fuel the strangest of passions, and it made no exception for the watchmaker; he realizes, in a moment of odd fixation, that the watch he had made for her has stopped. This fact consumes him; it becomes an outlet for the torrent of emotion that rages within his frame. He decides, in a mania caused by heartbreak, that he must fix it.

He brings it to his workbench and begins to take it apart. He works with an attention uncanny in its intensity. There is a knock on the door, but he does not answer it; he is hungry but does not feel it.  The knock comes again. His hands move with a grace ill-fitted for their size, his long, lean fingers well-adapted for such a delicate task as this. He finishes in just a few hours, having found no flaw in his design. It seems, however, to tick again, and the watchmaker begins to turn the hands towards  their rightful spot. He hesitates; in a moment of weakness, he turns the hands back instead to the moment he arrived at her door.

But a curious thing happens to the watchmaker as he turns those watch hands back. The world begins to dissolve around him, turning into a haze that only dimly reveals his surroundings. He sees the colors bend and change from brown to white until they stop and then he finds, much to his surprise, that he stands in front of her door, box in hand. He pauses for a moment, confused completely by what has just happened. He hears the lock slide from the inside.

“What the heck are you doing here?” she says, opening the door. She wears the same black dress, her hair down again in its marvelous curls. The watchmaker still thinks she is beautiful. “I'm so sorry, I didn't hear you knock! Get inside, you must be frozen. How long have you been there?”

And so the watchmaker relives, in a slightly different fashion, the events of that terrible moment. He relives her rejection of him and his gift; he relives that long walk home immersed in retrospection. But he thinks about something else on that walk home, and his spirits are lifted. The watchmaker, you see, has been given hope.

He realizes that the watch must be blessed by some magical power, by the force of his love; he realizes that it can take him back to that moment again and again. He realizes that he has a thousand different ways and a thousand different chances to win her back- he has been given the chance to right, by trial if need be, whatever wrong he had committed to lose her!

And so each time the watchmaker returns home he turns the watch hands back, and each time he is brought back again to her doorstep. He tries his thousand different ways, and when those fail he tries a thousand more. The days turn to months and the months into years, and still the watchmaker does not stop; he stays young and tall and lean and he is struck again and again by her beauty which does not fade. He knocks at her door always with a confidence that this time will be the time that she throws her arms around him. Such a devotion is rare these days- indeed in any day- and to watch him try again and again could rouse even the coldest of hearts.

And sometimes the watchmaker comes close. Sometimes he appeals to her sense of reason, and those times he sees her face waver, stricken by indecision before she makes her choice against him. Sometimes he appeals to her passion, and he holds her so tightly that he hopes she cannot help but hold him too. These times she almost gives in; she sees the love on the watchmaker's face, and it is a long, painful moment before she tells him to go.

But it is not the watchmaker's fault that she spurns him, and it is not within his power to reclaim her. And as the years move on and on, the watchmaker begins to realize this. His knocks begin to lose their vigor, and his efforts towards her heart begin to lose their passion. His walks back home carry less and less a mood of hope, slipping once again into the despair that consumed him when first he walked that path. The last time the knock is barely a rap upon the wood, and he offers the watch with a slow, defeated hand. It is desperate and pitiful; a gesture born only of habit and the last dying embers of hope.

And so this walk home is different. The watchmaker returns home, but he cannot wind the watch. He is at last exhausted, and he looks at it. He laughs a nervous, tired laugh; he is convinced it is the devil's work- a gleaming, tempting thing that offers nothing but false hope and endless rejection. He does not bring it to the workbench.

And of course it does not tick; it waits patiently to be repaired, as it has been countless times before. Even now, after all this time, the watchmaker longs to wind it; he longs to see her. Maybe this time will be different? Maybe this last, final time will work? That corner of the mind nags him still, but he is strong. To see the watchmaker resist reaching for his tools is to witness a feat of will, and he does not dare to move lest his hands fall into an all-too-familiar pattern. He waits, silent, and he hears a knock on the door.

It is a knock that he has heard innumerable times before; it is the knock that occurs when he begins to repair the watch. He has ignored it time and again, his attentions always focused elsewhere. This time, however, the watchmaker rises from his table and does not move to his workbench; he moves instead to the door.

A woman is there, her nose red and numb from the cold outside. She lives next door to him, and they have met on a few occasions. He barely suppresses a smile when he remembers she moved in last year; for the watchmaker, it has been a lifetime.

“Hi!” she says. “Um, I was wondering if I could borrow some sugar? I don't have any, and I can't exactly run to the store right now.”

“Yeah, of course.” he says. The words seem foreign to him. “Come in, you look frozen.”

“Thanks so much!” she says. She laughs. “Sugar's kind of important for muffins, you know.”

“Yeah, it is.” he says. “Sit down, make yourself comfortable. Wait here, I'll be back in a second.”

He goes into his kitchen and scours the cabinets, looking for sugar. He finds it after some effort, and smiles; it's been quite a long time since he's been in here, indeed. He walks back into the living room and notices her drop the watch onto the table. She brings her hands up to her mouth, embarrassed.

“Oh gosh! I'm so sorry. My mind just kind of wandered off, and I noticed that your watch stopped, and I put it forward so that it would be the right time and it started ticking again.” she says. “It looks really expensive. I shouldn't have touched it. I'm sorry!”

“No, it's fine. It wasn't expensive, actually.” he says to her, placing the sugar on the table.

“Really?” she says. “It's so beautiful. I can't imagine where you got it.”

“I made it.” he says. “A long time ago.”

“You made this? I've never seen anything like it. You're really good!” she says, picking up the watch. “It looks like it was made yesterday.”

“Yeah, yeah it does.” he says. And this time he cannot contain his smile. He marvels at how easy it comes.

“Well, I guess I'd better go back and make my muffins.” she says, rising from the table. She giggles nervously. “Muffins don't make themselves, you know!”

“Nope.” he says. She retreats to the door and into the hallway, and the watchmaker hears the door click shut. He is not ten steps away from it when he hears a knock again.

“Hey, um...” she says, hesitant. “I, uh, this makes a lot of muffins, and since it's your sugar and stuff I feel bad. Do you maybe want to have some? I can come get you and stuff and we can hang out.”

“Sure.” says the watchmaker. “I've got time to spare tonight.”

“Awesome!” she says. He can see the relief spread across her face, a wonderful, uncontrollable sign of joy. “Um, I guess I'll wait while you get your coat and stuff.”

And so he makes his way out into the cold once more, but in a different direction now. He shuts the door slowly but surely. But for the tick-tick of a lonely watch on the kitchen table, there would be silence.
