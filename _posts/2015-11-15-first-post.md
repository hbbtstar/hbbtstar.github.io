### First Post

Got this blogging system working! Sweet. Now I can update everything!

First post manifesto: this blog will not be solely a blog about technology,
though it will include much of that: I intend to blog semi-periodically about
any interesting technical things I encounter, normally Python / JS / C# related,
but also about anything else that interests me (including writing, which is
one of my primary non-tech related hobbies).

So there it is. Signing off!
