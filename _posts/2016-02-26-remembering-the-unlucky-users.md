title: Remembering the Unlucky Users
---

I was working on a fairly vexing bug yesterday that I have yet to figure out. The details of the bug, as it happens, are mostly unimportant: what is important is that it affects almost nobody. More specifically, it affects about 0.003% of our total events for any given day (I actually suspect it may be slightly more, given the nature of the problem, though I've yet to find any evidence of that suspicion). The important point about these numbers, however, is that they are negligible; they are below negligible. For a non-mission-critical app, they are well within an acceptable margin of error.

Or rather, they would be- if they were not all happening to a handful of users.
